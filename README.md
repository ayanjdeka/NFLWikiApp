# NFLWikiApp
I created an Android NFL Wiki - similar to Wikipedia, but for anything related to the NFLâ€™s teams and its players. Users would be able to search teams, players and compare statistics. They could also be referred to different sites to buy upcoming tickets to football games, and could set their favorite teams and favorite player based on the account that was signed in. The integrated features and technology used included Amazon Fire DB to store user information, Google Authentication API to identify user information, and SportDataIO APIs to be able to get NFL Team,player data, and statistics.
